                <h3>Hand Guesture recognition model using Deep learning</h3>
                <P>I have developed a robust Hand Gesture Recognition model as part of my academic
                    projects. Leveraging deep learning techniques, I designed a convolutional neural network
                    (CNN) architecture to accurately identify and classify various hand gestures in real-time. The
                    model, implemented using Python and TensorFlow, demonstrates high accuracy in
                    interpreting intricate hand movements. To enhance its practicality, I integrated the model
                    with a webcam interface, allowing seamless interaction through recognized gestures.
                    Through extensive testing and fine-tuning, the hand gesture model showcases its efficacy in
                    diverse scenarios, from sign language interpretation to intuitive control applications. This
                    project not only highlights my proficiency in machine learning but also underscores my
                    ability to apply this knowledge to create practical and impactful solutions.

                <h3>Shopping Cart Application Using Java Servelet and JSP</h3>
                <p>For my Java-based mini project, I developed a dynamic and user-friendly Shopping Cart Web
                    Application using Java Servlets. The application allows users to browse a diverse range of
                    products, add items to their cart, and seamlessly proceed to checkout. Leveraging Java
                    Servlets, I implemented efficient session management to track user interactions and
                    maintain their shopping carts throughout the browsing session. The application
                    incorporates a secure login system, ensuring user data privacy. Additionally, I integrated
                    functionalities such as product search, quantity adjustment, and order confirmation. The
                    responsive design and intuitive user interface enhance the overall shopping experience.
                    This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in Java Servlets but also highlights my
                    ability to create interactive and functional web applications.
